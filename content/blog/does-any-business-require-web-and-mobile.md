It doesn't matter what size your business is or will be, it doesn't matter what your industry and who is your ideal customer is. I have seen firsthand the impact of mobile apps and web development on businesses. Here are 4 obvious reasons with examples why your business needs web and mobile    

### **How to reach and engage customers?**    

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQFWARf6Ym243w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1678185906250?e=1694649600&v=beta&t=cl1IxuXNwi3iU9S-a3PsRvVu1ErEwCoXAI22vj_h7ME)

For example, consider the real estate industry, in which there is very tough competition for a client. Each time it becomes more and more difficult to hone the services provided to perfection so that the client chooses you. 

Digitalization is changing the rules of the game. The potential of e-services is enormous, and perhaps infinite. This does not mean dragging the real estate into the meta-universe. Using the example of our client, it is enough just to come up with an optimized system of bidding and negotiations. 

Congratulations, you have been awarded the “Most Innovative Brokerage” and have an unconditional advantage over your competitors.  

### New-level optimization and automatization of business processes.

I often like to talk about the fact that business has a lot of headaches. Imagine a retail company in the Automotive industry that has a great flow of orders for auto parts, each order needs to be formed, collected, and sent, but ... parts are in different warehouses, and orders are not filled immediately (you need to wait for some parts), parts are completely different sizes and they can be difficult to find even within the same warehouse. 

Do you still have not a headache?    

The well-designed order processing system, e-warehouse with the registration of all parts and all orders in this system, and ! Surprise ! Head no longer hurts    

### Looking for ways to reduce costs and increase profit.

What will a business do when it needs skilled workers? What will skilled workers do to find work? That's right, everyone goes to expensive staffing agencies and increases their expenses, not always getting the desired result (because the staffing agency also has its own interests). 

Here is the solution we helped develop—a Digital community for Clinics, Healthcare managers, and their employees and contractors. Now you do not spend the extra money and get a predictable result   

### Where to find the way to scale?

How can a hospital scale? Just think about it. Hire more specialists and give everyone their own office? Expensive and inefficient. As I said before, web and mobile apps are game changers. 

Online appointments, video consultations, and built-in online purchase of medicines - equals infinite scaling for business. In truth, you get the opportunity to grow only by attracting new customers and optimizing your costs and internal processes.

### A little conclusion.

As a digital business consultant, I highly recommend that businesses explore web and mobile tools to stay competitive in today's rapidly changing business landscape. Are there no challenges? Of course, they are. The next article will prepare you for it. 

**But if you still haven't thought about how to digitalize your business, at least start thinking about it now.** Tomorrow, you will no longer need this.
