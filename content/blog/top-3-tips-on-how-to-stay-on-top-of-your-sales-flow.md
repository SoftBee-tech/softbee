It happens that you take on a large client, and your company's profits depend on 50+ % of the work with this client! If you're in this situation, change something immediately!\
\
Yes, the temptation is great, everything is going well now, there's no stress, the client is already in good relations with you, and it's like a family, and that's really cool! But not for business! Not for business.\
\
Unfortunately, the client is just an ordinary man and may stop funding, or some family problems or natural disasters may happen! You may find yourself in a risky situation where you have to draw from your reserves, or even dip into your own pocket to cover your employees' salaries.\
\
**My advice on what to do if you haven't already found yourself in this situation:**

* Don't put all your eggs in one basket, meaning look for more clients so that your income doesn't depend on one project or one client.
* Invest in [\#marketing](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=marketing&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7041316629149851650) and [\#sales](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=sales&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7041316629149851650) departments.
* Expand your staff by hiring people hourly to take on as many projects as possible without sticking to just one.\
