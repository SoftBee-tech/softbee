Outstaffing has proven to be a cost-effective and efficient way to handle complex projects and provide high-quality services to clients.

From my own experience, I have witnessed firsthand the benefits of outstaffing and the challenges that come with transforming a business into an outstaff model. In this article, I will share my experiences and insights into the world of outstaffing, including why it can be profitable, how to prepare for the transition and the myths and truths about outstaffing.

What should you prepare your company, team, and yourself for? How can you avoid confusing customers and where can you find new ones? These are just a few of the questions that will be addressed in this article. Whether you're a small business owner or a large enterprise, this article will provide valuable information on the risks and rewards of outstaffing.

## WHY OUTSTAFF

Because it's profitable for both, IT company and its client.

Yes, the highest added value on Fixed Cost. But here you, as a vendor, bear great risks. So, where the outstaff will take 100K, the fixed cost will take 200K to cover their risks. That is why outstaff is beneficial to the client. On the other side, you will take much fewer risks.

💥 Go bankrupt or close altogether

💥 Lose 50% of the team or friends, because they will also change or simply leave without accepting your strategy. It will not work to remain a family company with 8,000 people 😉

## BEGIN THE TRANSFORMATION

Change the environment, and sometimes - developers. Either they will change, or we will have to say goodbye to them.

> ***BAD CLIENTS BRING BAD CLIENTS AND GOOD CLIENTS BRING GOOD CLIENTS.***

So stop working with those who are not profitable, steal your time, spam on weekends, delay payment, etc.

### TRANSFORM YOUR CLIENTS

We understood that it would not be possible to take on and transfer all clients to outstaff at the same time.

Therefore, we calculated how much Fixed-Cost can really cost with all the risks. We got almost 2 times more for outstaff. So we just say, ok, on outstaff, it costs, for example, 10,000, and on Fixed Cost, it costs 20,000, chooses.

### LEAD SEARCH CHANNELS

✔ have your clients to "refer" you

✔ Upwork

✔ Clutch

✔ Content Marketing

✔ Job portals (Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn)

✔ Slack community

✔ go to webinars attended by your buyer persona

✔ partner leads

✔ even subcontracts



### TIME AND PROBATION PERIOD

1️⃣Sometimes clients are hesitant because they have never worked with outstaff. Therefore, we give a trial period of 1-2 weeks.

2️⃣Your task is to quickly "staff" the team and release developers. This may require a bench or resource exchange.

3️⃣If you do not "staff" the team, then you risk losing a lot of money.

### WHY CHECK DEVELOPERS

At Outstaff, your developer meets with your client. Therefore, he should understand in which company he works.

How he communicates, whether he communicates, whether he knows the language, whether he meets deadlines, whether he does not disappear suddenly - all this makes your reputation.

Check out the developers. And don't try to sell Junior for Senior.

Give only qualified personnel. In outstaffing, you can afford higher salaries.

## LET'S SUM UP

To transfer a company to Outstaff, you need:

✔ Define mission and values

✔ Compile the UCP and portrait of the ideal client

✔ Analyze UCP according to GFS and SWOT

✔ Make a financial model for at least one year

✔ Adjust lead generation and qualification

✔ To work with clients qualitatively, for reputation, to report on time

✔ Keep following your developers

***Reject doubts and let your company growth!***
