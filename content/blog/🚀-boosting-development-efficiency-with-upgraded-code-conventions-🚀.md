So, what the importance of rules and conventions in the way we write code? The immense. They serve as the guiding principles that shape our codebase and contribute to its long-term maintainability and scalability.

**Today, I want to share some thoughts on this topic and shed light on how our team has leveraged our own upgraded version of these covenants.**

Undoubtedly, books like "Code Complete" by McConnell and "Clean Code" by Martin offer valuable insights and established conventions that are essential for projects likely to be passed on to other teams.

However, when our team handles projects from start to finish and beyond, it becomes crucial to tailor our rules and conventions to our specific needs and preferences. This allows us to optimize our workflow and leverage our collective expertise to the fullest extent.

**Two fundamental aspects must be kept in mind while implementing these upgraded covenants: enforcing them for everyone and ensuring they do not contradict one another.**

But nobody likes rules! How to force developers to follow them? In general, this will have to be strictly monitored for about a month, until everyone gets used to it BUT... AIs such as GPT or Copilot have proven to be invaluable allies in this regard.

After just a week of utilizing our upgraded rules, the AI itself actively reminds our developers of them, promoting adherence and streamlining the development process. This has resulted in a staggering 30% increase in our team's productivity and efficiency.

Our custom code conventions not only provide a solid foundation for collaboration and knowledge sharing within our team but also foster a sense of ownership and empowerment among our developers.

By creating an environment where everyone's ideas and expertise are valued, we have unlocked a new level of innovation and productivity.

In conclusion, while established books like "Perfect Code" and "Clean Code" are highly valuable resources, they should serve as a starting point rather than a rigid set of rules for projects we handle from start to finish. 

By developing our own upgraded code conventions, backed by AI-driven enforcement, we have witnessed significant improvements in our development speed and overall quality.
