title: The good, the bad, and the ugly developer

Let's start with the example: You possess an expensive vessel and hold the position of its captain, however, you lack any crew members. What would occur if you advertise the job and hastily select the initial few dozen applicants? The probable outcome is that you will swiftly lose possession of your ship (and potentially even lose your life).

Although it may seem that in a large-scale project, nothing depends on the developer, this is not so. The developer is the one responsible for crafting your product or service, making them an indispensable aspect of your business. Deciding whom to employ for your projects, whom to dismiss, and establishing what you expect from your developers from their initial day at work is crucial and will be discussed in this article.

## Personality

Soft skills, hard skills, medium skills - never mind. Learn to see people in people. If a building has a bad foundation, then no matter what the interior and exterior are, it is bad. Consequently, regardless of how articulate and competent a professional may be, they are Ugly if:

### Not open to adventure and new

Individuals who are not receptive to novelty and adventure view challenges as annoying troubles, are frequently discontented, and remarkably possess fewer resources compared to those who like to take on challenges, who catch a buzz from everything new and look beyond the horizon. It is effortless to detect such characteristics in a developer's resume and personal life. How do they respond to challenges and setbacks? How do they perceive it? What actions do they take? Trust me, even having a single unmotivated developer on board can spoil the entire atmosphere of your team.

### Love money more than code

Every professional deserves fair compensation for their work. As previously mentioned, developers play a vital role in creating a product or service, so this isn't about saving your money. However, hiring someone who just wants to take their money and go home will never result in quality work. 

They are not concerned about producing a high-quality product or meeting deadlines, nor are they interested in collaborating with their colleagues. If a person's only focus is money, it is impossible to retain them in the long run. Based on experience, individuals who are the least invested in a project are often the first to complain about their pay (within two weeks of beginning work on the project.)

### Dishonest or dishonorable

A developer's conscience and integrity are crucial in ensuring that they carry out their work with worth, honesty, and attentiveness, going the extra mile for you (appreciate such developers). No matter how skillfully you craft the developer's job description, you cannot substitute basic human integrity. It is vital to have trustworthy and honorable developers on your team to guarantee the success of your project.

## Soft-Skills

Now that we've identified capable individuals who relish the challenge and enjoy coding, what's the next step? Even if your programmer possesses the previous qualities, they can still be considered Bad if they:

### Have a lack of the ability to communicate effectively

Regrettably, such individuals who do not know how to understand and be understood do exist, and it is easy to spot this trait during the interview process. We all understand how it happens and recognize the potential risks and consequences that come with poor communication skills in a development team.

### Frequently say "no"

Statements like "I haven't worked with this," "I don't know how to do this," or "This is not my area of expertise" can create a backlog of tasks that cannot be completed, despite having a fully staffed team. 

While it is understandable that individuals cannot be experts in every field, it is essential to surround yourself with those who have a willingness to learn and problem-solve. Look for those who say "I can learn this," "I'll figure out how to do it," or "Can I take it on?". 

It is also crucial to assess tasks realistically, taking into account their complexity and time costs, as unrealistic expectations can cause developers to be afraid to take on new challenges and simply say "no".

### Wait to be organized

Some developers require a lot of hand-holding and management to be productive. This can be identified when, at the end of a work period, the developer claims that there were not enough tasks, and the manager or team lead is hearing about it for the first time. 

While a well-structured team can help alleviate some issues, the simple self-organization of each developer is an indispensable phenomenon in the project.

## Hard Skills

Great, we've got developers who understand and are understood, don't say "no" out of habit, and know how to organize themselves. But your developer is truly Good if they:

### Keep up-to-date with industry knowledge

Although everyone has their own technical preferences, even a surface-level awareness of new developments, current trends, or how developers of other stacks operate can give your team and project a significant edge.

### Adhere to the latest technologies and practices in their technical stack

This point is self-explanatory

### Expand their technical stack

Take a look at your developers' CVs from a year ago and compare them to their current versions. Have they added any new technologies to their stack? The benefits of this are obvious.

## As a result,

we get developers similar to those whom I can let touch my projects. So, a good developer must possess a combination of technical skills, soft skills, and ethical values. 

They must be open to adventure, passionate about coding, honest, and possess a strong work ethic. Additionally, they must possess good communication skills, be willing to learn and expand their knowledge base and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and practices. 

By hiring the right developers and providing them with the necessary resources, you can set your project up for success and achieve your business goals.
