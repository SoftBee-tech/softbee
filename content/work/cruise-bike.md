    Task


    Develop a mobile app that allows vehicle owners to share their scooters or bicycles with others and earn money, while also providing customers with an affordable means of transportation.


    Solution


    We took part in developing a map-based Uber-Like mobile app. When vehicle owners sign up, they receive a U-lock with a Bluetooth chip inside. Wherever they lock a U-lock via the app, that position will be displayed on a map inside the app. Users can locate bikes and scooters in the app and unlock them using their smartphone cameras. The app tracks how long a user rides, gives a way to pay for a ride, adds an ability to request vehicles for future rides, and tracks where the user left a vehicle so the owner or other users can locate one.
