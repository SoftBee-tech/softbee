    ### üìù TASK 


    To create an application that can allow users to be interested in eco-friendly behavior. 381 million tons of plastic waste are produced annually in the world - by 2034 this figure will double. Any, even the most moral behavior should be encouraged. For this, the Trovr and Trovr-Merchant applications were developed. 


    ### üì±üì± SOLUTION 


    The purpose of creating the application is to provide "rewards for recycling". Subscribers earn bonus points through the application for recycling glass, plastic, and aluminum bottles or containers at one of the machines of the national and international recycling network, located in places such as outlets, supermarkets, highway service areas, gas stations, transport hubs (air, buses, railway), as well as in other public places. These reward points can be redeemed for vouchers offered through the app and redeemed online or straight at the shop (through the synchronized mobile app Trovr Merchant) for vouchers offered by thousands of big-name brands and retailers.
