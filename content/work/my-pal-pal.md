    ### TASK 


    Due to the huge number and variety of private doctors and clinics in New York, it can be difficult to find the right specialist and make sure that insurance covers their services. It was necessary to create an application that facilitates the search, appointment, and giving feedback for the services of the attending doctor. 


    ### SOLUTION 


    There was created mobile app that collects information about the user's insurance package and his needs and offers him suitable specialist options based on the: 


    * Compliance of qualifications with the needs of the patient; 

    * Coverage of doctor's services by insurance; 

    * Ratings and reviews of a medical specialist; 

    * The location of the clinic and the patient (priority is the shortest distance). 


    Having chosen a suitable specialist, the patient can book a consultation. Sometime before the appointment, he will receive a notification, and after the appointment, he will be able to leave a review about the Doctor, while receiving a reward.
