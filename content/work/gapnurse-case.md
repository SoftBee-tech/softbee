  title: They really help hospitals to stay productive and helpful
  text: >
    With GapNurse medical facilities know theyâ€™re covered during critical times,
    especially while coping with COVID-19. At the same time it won't break your
    budget
  textInfo: >-
    The main idea of the app is to help to connect empowered healthcare workers
    with medical organizations that need help in caring for people. We
    successfully delivered the MVP, so the client can spread the app to alpha
    testers


    Medical facilities can publish assignments for healthcare workers, both their employees and independent contractors, via a web portal. Healthcare workers can find assignments via the app that work with their schedule and receive some payment.


    Users can accept or reject assignments, view their schedule, receive notifications about future events, read assignments descriptions, mark them as done, get paid, and track their success.


    **Responsibilities** Front End Development. Cooperate with [Demigos ](https://demigos.com/)worked on creating new app.
