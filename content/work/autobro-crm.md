    ## Task: 


    Create an e-commerce online store to sell car parts. 


    ## Solutions: 


    We have created an online store with tens of thousands of auto parts items. All orders are automatically entered into our developed CRM system. Car parts mainly from the large TecDoc database, but also from the databases of various suppliers. There is a possibility of own catalog filling. Despite the fact that working with the API of different suppliers is not easy, we have optimized queries well and made everything for the convenience of the user 


    ## Features: 


    * Authorization via email (in development - via social networks) 

    * Product catalog with multiple filters 

    * Pages without reloading (SSR) 

    * Shopping cart Block of promotions and top products 

    * Product page with a detailed description 

    * Variable prices from different suppliers 

    * Smart filter for auto parts selection 

    * Checkout page (online payment is under development) 

    * Buyer's personal cabinet 




    ## Tech stack: 


    JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Material UI, GraphQL, Node js, Strapi, styled-components, API integration
