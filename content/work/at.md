    ### ðŸ“Œ Solution


    We created a CRM system with an integrated digital warehouse. The system directly interacts with the online store, and displays the customer and his status, his orders and the status of orders. There is the possibility to form automatic orders (for external suppliers). A huge part of this system is the digital warehouse, which displays, right down to the shelf space, where the goods should be stored and from where they can be picked up.


    ### ðŸ“ŒFeatures:


    Customer database

    Search and filtering

    Order database

    Automatic order status update

    Automatic ordering (external supplier integration)

    Delivery Tracking

    Electronic warehouse

    Automatic order assembly

    Prepayment + Refund

    Generation of QR codes + barcodes


    ### ðŸ“ŒTech:


    React, Next.js, MUI, NodeJS, GraphQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, Strapi, API integration, TecDoc
