    ### **üìù Task** 


    –°reate an opportunity for doctors to receive patients, and conduct examinations and diagnostics online. Our scope of work includes the front-end part of WEB and the development of MOBILE apps.

    #### ***Client-faced*** 


    Web and mobile applications are designed so that the user can get the maximum possible number of services without leaving home. Tests requesting, consultation, ordering medicines - all these functions are easy and quick to use at any time. 


    #### ***For doctors*** 


    Unlike patients, doctors use this app all the time, so it's designed for their needs:
