    ðŸ“Œ **Task** 


    Create a platform where sellers could list their real estate for sale, and buyers could purchase real estate in a real-time auction format. 


    ðŸ“Œ **Solution** 


    The patent-pending plumBid gives Buyers, Sellers, and Agents the power to fine-tune and adjust the deal, so everyone has the advantage. The seller first uses plumBid to prioritize the terms that are most important to them, including Final sales price, Cash down from the buyer, Length of the escrow period, and Inspection, loan, and appraisal contingencies. Then the Buyer uses the platform to know exactly what the seller actually wants, create the most competitive offer, and make a completely transparent and fair deal faster than ever. 


    ðŸ“Œ **Features** 


    * User Profile Creation (with 3 roles) 

    * Complex Calculate System 

    * Chat integration 

    * File Uploading 

    * Calendar Scheduler (booking) 

    * Mailing by e-mail 

    * Highly structured database 

    * Regular Updated Timer  


    ðŸ“Œ **Key solutions/ Insights** 


    ***Uniquely transparent*** 


    The platform solves one of the most vexing issues in real estate - the lack of perceived or actual transparency and fairness during a transaction. Utilizing it to negotiate the final price and terms is proven to be better for the seller, buyer, and real estate agent. No guessing how many other buyers are interested or how much you need to pay to secure a property. No preferential treatment -- with all parties in control of their process and outcome. 


    ***Flexible*** 


    The platform takes the seller's preferences and layers current economic conditions to determine the bid incentives â€” which clearly lets all buyers know whatâ€™s important and how to craft the best and most compelling offer. 


    ***Extremely fast*** 


    Tired of drawn-out, back-and-forth negotiations, comparing competing offers, and days of generating countless counter-offers? PlumBid does it automatically online through a powerful, proprietary patent-pending software technology bidding platform.
