  text: Working alone sucks, so we teamed up to kick ass together. We prove that distance doesn’t matter when you love what you do, plus we don’t have to share biscuits.
  title: Real people creating real results
letsTalk:
  text: We’re designers, developers, illustrators, copywriters and coders, but we
    also have pure gold ideas. iPhone games, time-keeping apps, dog-backpacks,
    too many tshirt slogans to keep track of. One day we’ll be rich, you’d best
    work with us while we need the money.
