    Working alone sucks, so we teamed up to kick ass together. We prove that
    distance doesn’t matter when you love what you do, plus we don’t have to
    share biscuits.

  We’re designers, developers, illustrators, copywriters and coders, but we also
  have pure gold ideas. iPhone games, time-keeping apps, dog-backpacks, too many
  tshirt slogans to keep track of. One day we’ll be rich, you’d best work with
  us while we need the money.
